gordy
=====

A components-compatible client side javascript library built on top of web sockets to connect to a custom server hosting live updates from globally distributed sensors

Gordy comes from the music label of El Debarge, the musical genius behind "Who's Johnny?", the theme track to the film _Short Circuit_, the lead robotic character being Johnny-Five, which is the inspiration for the johnny-five Node.js module that we use to connect our Raspberry Pi remote servers to an Arduino that connects to our sensors.
